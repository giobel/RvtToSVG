        <h1>Spectacles Embed Example 5 --- View and Selection</h1>
        <p>In this example we'll load a single model in a dedicated div, and provide UI to control views in the model (load pre-set views from the json file, zoom extents, zoom selected), as well as element selection and attribute display.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Free and Open Source</h2>
        <p>Yeah, so as you are probably already aware, Spectacles is a free and open source 3D model viewer that runs in the browser and can render files that were exported from Revit or Grasshopper using the Spectacles exporters for those platforms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Totally hackable</h2>
        <p>Not much of a hack in this example, but because the code is open it's totally up to you in terms of customization.  Want to pull attributes from a database when an element is selected?  Go for it!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Embeddable</h2>
        <p>As this example shows, it's relatively straightforward to embed a custom viewer in any webpage.  Just reference the required javascript and css files in your head tag, block out a div and pass it to our SPECTACLES constructor function along with your json data.</p>
